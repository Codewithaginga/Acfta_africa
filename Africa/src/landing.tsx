          The AfCFTA is one of the flagship projects of Agenda 2063: The Africa
          We Want. It is a high ambition trade agreement, with a comprehensive
          scope that includes critical areas of Africas economy, such as digital
          trade and investment protection, amongst other areas. By eliminating
          barriers to trade in Africa, the objective of the AfCFTA is to
          significantly boost intra-Africa trade, particularly trade in
          value-added production and trade across all sectors of Africas
          economy.
